# Waveshare ESP32-S3 Touch AMOLED 2.16

Rust/`esp-hal` bring-up project for the
[Waveshare ESP32-S3-Touch-AMOLED-2.16][board-docs].

The firmware initializes the CO5300 over QSPI and renders an interactive
480 × 480 Slint UI from a PSRAM framebuffer. Dirty rectangles use Slint's
physical alignment API required by the CO5300. The UI
has overview, display, power, and RTC sections sized for the panel's
rounded-corner safe area.

## Current status

- `esp-hal` 1.1 with Embassy/`esp-rtos`
- generated BLE/`trouble-host` stack retained
- 8 MiB octal PSRAM allocator
- CO5300 reset and official Waveshare initialization sequence
- RGB565 big-endian partial framebuffer uploads over QSPI at 40 MHz
- full-stride rectangles coalesced into whole-DMA-buffer transfers
- 2 × 2 aligned Slint dirty regions
- CST9220 touch input over the shared 400 kHz I²C bus
- interrupt-driven Slint pointer events (`TP_INT=GPIO11`, `TP_RST=GPIO40`)
- a dropped touch release edge is recovered by re-polling the controller
- AXP2101 battery, VBUS, VSYS, state-of-charge, and die-temperature telemetry
- PCF85063ATL battery-backed clock with oscillator-state detection
- on-device date and time editor with write-back verification
- interactive brightness control using the CO5300 `0x51` panel command
- PWR short press toggles CO5300 sleep; 2.5 s hold opens the power menu
- powering on from the AXP2101 off state requires a 2 s PWR hold
- power menu actions for AXP2101 soft power-off and ESP32-S3 restart
- AMOLED-black multi-page UI with overview, display, power, and RTC sections

IMU, audio, SD, and BLE application services are not wired yet; the
generated BLE/`trouble-host` stack remains initialized.
The firmware has been flashed and its full-frame plus aligned partial-frame
paths complete successfully on the physical board according to RTT/defmt.
CO5300, CST9220, AXP2101, and PCF85063 initialization all succeed on the
physical board.
The UI, orientation, colors, CST9220 IRQ/coordinate mapping, press/release
events, page navigation, and brightness controls have been verified on the
physical AMOLED board.

The AXP2101 setup intentionally changes no board-specific regulator rails. It
configures the installed 1000mAh, 4.2V cell for 500mA charging, and enables
battery detection plus the ADC channels used for telemetry. Brightness is
independent of the PMIC on this AMOLED board.

## Measured frame cost

The firmware times rendering and panel upload separately. The first eight
frames are logged at `info` as a boot benchmark; set `DEFMT_LOG=debug` for
rolling batch summaries. Release build, 240 MHz, 40 MHz QSPI:

| | full frame | typical partial update |
|---|---|---|
| pixels | 230 400 | 700 – 1 800 |
| render | 124 ms | 4.4 – 5.2 ms |
| upload | 47 ms | 0.5 – 0.8 ms |
| DMA transfers | 60 | one per row |

Rendering dominates everywhere: 72 % of a full frame and roughly 88 % of a
small update. Two separate costs make it up — about 0.6 µs per pixel, and a
fixed ~4 ms per frame that does not scale with the dirty region at all, so a
700-pixel update spends under half a millisecond on pixels.

Full-frame upload runs at 9.7 MB/s, near half the 20 MB/s ceiling for four
lines at 40 MHz, and is bandwidth-bound rather than transfer-bound. Row
coalescing cuts a full frame from 480 transfers to 60, which is worth roughly
17 % of the upload; narrow rectangles stay overhead-bound at 20 – 35 µs per
transfer regardless of payload.

## Source layout

- `src/bin/main.rs` — hardware setup, task wiring, and the UI event loop
- `src/board.rs` — panel dimensions and the board pin table
- `src/co5300.rs` — CO5300 QSPI transport, aligned region uploads, brightness
- `src/events.rs` — task-to-UI events and the wait that drives the loop
- `src/frame_stats.rs` — per-frame render and upload timing
- `src/pmic.rs` — conservative AXP2101 setup and telemetry
- `src/rtc.rs` — PCF85063 probe, calendar reads, and date/time conversion
- `src/slint_platform.rs` — minimal Slint platform adapter
- `src/tasks.rs` — touch, PMIC, and RTC tasks
- `src/ui.rs` — generated Slint types, display helpers, callback wiring
- `ui/main.slint` — rounded-safe interactive AMOLED UI

The UI loop waits rather than polls: it sleeps until a peripheral task reports
in, the uptime second rolls over, or an animation is due. Each task owns its
peripheral and publishes to the channel group it is handed, so `main` is the
only place that decides which task talks to what.

## Build

```sh
git clone https://github.com/okhsunrog/waveshare-esp32s3-amoled-2-16.git
cd waveshare-esp32s3-amoled-2-16
cargo build --release
```

Cargo fetches everything, including Slint. The dirty-region alignment API the
CO5300 needs is not in a Slint release yet, so `slint` and `slint-build` come
from upstream Slint's `master` branch; `Cargo.lock` pins the exact commit. Once
the API lands in a release, both can move back to crates.io.

The generated runner uses the ESP32-S3 USB-JTAG interface:

```sh
cargo run --release
```

Hardware values and the initialization sequence are based on the
[official Waveshare examples][vendor-repo].
